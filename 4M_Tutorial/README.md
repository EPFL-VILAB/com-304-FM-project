# 4M Tutorial README

Welcome to the **4M (Massively Multimodal Masked Modeling) Tutorial**! This tutorial is an introduction to working with a multimodal foundation model, specifically **4M** (https://4m.epfl.ch/), and will guide you through its setup and hands-on exercises for generation and retrieval tasks.

## Installation

Before running the notebooks, follow [Environment.md](Environment.md) to install the required dependencies.

## Getting Started

Once the setup is complete, start exploring pre-trained **4M** models by completing the following Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Part 01: Multi-modal Generation** – Run [`Part_01_4M_generation.ipynb`](./Part_01_4M_generation.ipynb).
2. **Part 02: Multi-modal Retrieval** – Run [`Part_02_4M_retrieval.ipynb`](./Part_02_4M_retrieval.ipynb).

This tutorial will help you understand the core functionalities of **4M** and allow you to to experiment with **multimodal generation and retrieval**. This should give you a good base to later-on implement and train your own **nano4M** from scratch!
